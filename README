Danbooru-daemon comprises a daemon to download images automatically from
danbooru-like sites and an offline browser GUI to search the downloaded
images by tags and other fields, licensed under Apache License 2.0.

First use:
* Copy the sample-config.cfg to ~/.danbooru-daemon.cfg and adapt it for
  your needs.
  
* Run the following:
  - "danbooru_daemon -a update" to download the image data from the site to
    the sqlite database.
  - "danbooru_daemon -a download" to download the images registered in the
    database.
  - "danbooru_daemon -a nepomuk" to tag the images downloaded with the info
    previously stored in the database.
  - "danbooru_daemon -a cleanup" to move the images who aren't in the database
    to the root image directory.
  - "danbooru_daemon -a daemon" to run update and download for every configured
    site, and retry after the specified ammount of time indicated in the config.
    
 The recommended setup is to run the danbooru_daemon as a daemon so it gets new
 images, tags and info periodically.
